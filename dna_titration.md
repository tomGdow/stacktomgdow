You are right in that as the pH is lowered, the secondary phosphoryl groups of DNA, 
_being exposed to the solvent_, will pick up protons.

(But note that no electrons are lost or gained in ionization/deionization)

The $pK_a$ of a secondary phosphoryl group is about 6.5 (see, for example,
<a href ="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/data-for-biochemical-research-9780198552994?cc=ie&lang=en&">Dawson et al., 1989</a>)
, 
and at pH values lower than (say) 5.5, 
such a group will be predominately in the protonated form.

Furthermore, 
the titration curve of DNA contains a group (in a relatively small amount) 
titrating in the range pH 5.5-7.5, 
which has been attributed to a secondary phosphoryl group 
(
[Gulland _et al_., 1947b](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18917690/))

Thus, at low pH values, 
all the secondary phosphoryl groups of DNA will be predominately protonated. 

You are also right in that ionization will affect hydrogen bonding, 
but it is the hydrogen bonding between base pairs ( A&#61;T and G&equiv;C) that are affected. 

In fact, the DNA titration curve provided early evidence, 
pre Watson and Crick,
for the importance of hydrogen bonding between bases in DNA
([Gulland _et al_., 1947b](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18917690/)),
and a re-reading of the papers of Gulland and co-workers
was influential in making Watson 
<blockquote>"finally realize the strength of their
conclusion that a large fraction, 
if not all, 
of the bases formed hydrogen bonds to other bases. Even more important, 
these hydrogen bonds were present at very low DNA concentrations, 
strongly hinting that the bonds linked together bases in the same molecules" 

(see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Masson_Gulland), 
and
[Booth and Hey, 1996](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ed073p928)) 
</blockquote>

The elucidation of the titration curve for DNA is also 'quite a story'.

Two buffer regions in the curve (Fig. 1) are explained by _ionization of the
bases_, and a hysteresis in the curves for the titration of DNA not exposed to
extremes of pH compared  to that of DNA back titrated from either very high or
very low pH was correctly interpreted _in 1947_  as strong evidence for
hydrogen bonding between bases (see below and 
[Harding _et al_., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195643/);
[Manchester, 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7709433/);
[Peacocke, 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15752988/)).

#### DNA Titration Curve

The potentiometric titration curve of the sodium salt of calf thymus DNA, 
dissolved in water, 
and prepared by a 'mild' method where all of the steps were done close to pH 7, 
is shown (in 'schematic form') in Fig. 1. 

This is based on the original diagram of 
[Gulland _et al_ (1947b)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18917690/),
which is reproduced by 
[Jordan (1960, p170)](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/zmf8jgbb), 
and should be available at 
[this link](https://archive.org/details/chemistryofnucle0000dojo/page/170/mode/2up?view=theater).

The image below has been taken from the Ph.D thesis of 
[J.M Creeth (1948)](www.nottingham.ac.uk/-sczsteve/PhDThesis_JMCreeth_UnivLondon1948.pdf)
(which is freely available on the Web, and which also gives a great review of
what was known about DNA structure before Watson and Crick, and how tantalizing
close some (including J.M Creeth) were to a major breakthrough).

The titration curve of DNA shows a number of interesting characteristics, 
<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Hysterisis</dt>
<dd>
Titration of DNA, initially at pH 7, with either acid (to pH 2), 
or with base (to pH 13), follows <b>curve 1</b> (forward titration).
However, back titration from pH 12 with acid (to pH 2), or with base from pH 2 (to pH
12), follows <b>curve 2</b>.
</dd>

</dl>
</li>
<li>In the forward titration (<b>curve 1</b>), 
the region between pH 5 and 11 is very flat compared with the rest of the curve, 
with no immediately obvious titration of any group.
</li>
<li>
A group (or groups) titrates in the region pH 2-5 (buffer region 1)
</li>
<li>
A group (or groups) titrates in the region pH 11-13 (buffer region 2)
</li>
<li>The forward titration (<b>curve 1</b>) is irreversible,
but the back titration (<b>curve 2</b>) is reversible: starting from pH 13 and
re-titrating to pH 2, or starting from pH 2 and re-titrating to pH 13 <b> follows
curve 2</b>

</li>
</ol> 

These observations have been interpreted as follows 
(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18917690/">Gulland _et al_., 1947b</a>):

<ol>
<li>
<p> The group(s) titrating in the range pH 2-5 is primarily attributed 
to the protonation/deprotonation of the amino groups of the guanine, adenine and
cytosine.
</p>  
<p> This conclusion was arrived at mainly by comparison with known 
<i>p</i>K<sub><i>a</i></sub>values for nucleotides.
 </p> 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_monophosphate">Adenylic Acid</a>
(AMP), for example, 
has $pK_a$ values of 0.89, 3.70 and 6.01,
corresponding to a “primary phosphoryl dissociation, 
an amino dissociation, and a  secondary phosphoryl dissociation”, respectively
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18917690/">(Gulland _et al_., 1947b)</a>

Gulland and co-workers initially ascribed the titration in the range pH 2-6 to the ionization of a
primary phosphoryl group, but acknowledged 
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18917690/">(Gulland _et al_., 1947b)</a>
that the conclusion of
<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)84861-X/fulltext">Levene and Simms (1924)</a>
(that the titration is due to deoxynucleotide amino groups) is correct. 
</li>
<li>

Groups titration in the region pH 8-12 are attributed to the ionization of
the [enolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enol) hydroxyl groups of guanine and
thymine

It is now known that the enol form of guanine and thymine is in equilibrium with the keto
form, where the keto form is greatly favoured at physiological pH (see
[here](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/a/95/1791), for example),
but this in no way negates the above conclusion. 

</li>
<li>A small amount of a group titrating with a $pK_a$ of 6-6.5, attributed to
a secondary phosphoryl group,explains curve 1 in the pH 5.5-7.5 range</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

<dd>The DNA was isolated by a mild method where the hydrogen ion concentration

<dd>Fibrous, viscous preparation was dissolved in water.</dd>
<dd><b>Curve 1</b> shows the titration of DNA, initially at pH 7, to pH 2 by adding
acid, or to pH 12 by the addition of alkali</dd>

<dd>Addition of either acid or alkali produced little change in pH between pH 5 and 11.</dd>
<dd>One group (or groups) titrates in the region pH 2-5, and another group (or groups) titrates in the range pH 9-12</dd>

<dd>**Curve 2** is obtained by back titration of the DNA sample, 
either from pH 12 with acid to pH 2, or from pH 2 with alkali to pH 12</dd>

<dd> 
The titration curve in the range pH 5.5-7.5 indicates the presence of a small
amount of a group having a pKa of around 6.5, attributed to be a secondary
phosphoryl group

#### John Masson Gulland

[John Masson Gulland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Masson_Gulland) was an eminent Scottish biochemist who worked at the University of Nottingham. 

Tragically, he was killed in 1947, very soon after the work described above was completed, in the [Goswick rail crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goswick_rail_crash), when the [flying scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Scotsman_(train)) derailed. 

#### Linus Pauling 

([Booth & Hey, 1996](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ed073p928))
draw attention to how close Linus Pauling, despite the triple-helix structure
publication, anticipated Watson and Crick's structure as early as 1948.  Pauling
visited Nottingham in 1948 to give the Sir Jesse Boot Foundation Lecture and had
this to say (as quoted by Booth and Hey)"

> If the structure that serves as a template (the gene or virus molecule)
> consists of, say, two parts, which are themselves complementary in structure,
> then each of these parts thus can serve as the mould for the duplication of
>itself.

(It is not clear if Pauling knew of the work of Gulland and colleagues).

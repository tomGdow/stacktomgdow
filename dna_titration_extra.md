For phosphoric acid,Dawson's [Data for Biochemical Research](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Biochemical-Research-Rex-Dawson/dp/0198552998) 

quotes three [pKa]() values: 2.15, 6.82 and 12.38. Therefore, phosphoric acid will be fully protonated only at very low pH values (see Fig 4 of [Titration of a Polyprotic Acid](https://www.chem.fsu.edu/chemlab/bluedoor_background.html) for a titration curve)


with a lesser contribution 
from the protonation of the secondary phosphate groups.

prefers the term 'irreversible titration phenomenon' to 'hysteresis'.)
